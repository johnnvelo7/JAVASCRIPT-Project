My final project in Javascript 

The folder contains all the codes that I wrote for my final exam in javascript. 
Disclaimer: I only had a few hours to write these codes that's why they are not that perfect.

The reason why we wrote javascript codes inside html was to make it easier for our teacher to read which task we were writing about.
